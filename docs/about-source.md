# Design Document

**1. Common Git for Different Programming Languages:**

- **Universality:** Git is an excellent choice for version control across various programming languages. Its core commands (add, commit, push, pull) remain consistent, making it a valuable tool to learn and master.
- **Language-Specific Tools:** While Git serves as the foundation, you might leverage language-specific tools alongside it. For instance, Python developers often utilize `pip` for package management, while Node.js projects rely on `npm` or `yarn`. These tools integrate seamlessly with Git, allowing you to track dependencies alongside your code changes.

**2. Mono Repo vs. Poly Repo: Considerations**

When structuring your project with multiple languages, decide between a mono repo (single repository) or a poly repo (multiple repositories):

  - **Mono Repo (Pros & Cons):**
    - **Pros:**
      - Streamlined version control: All code resides in one location, simplifying management.
      - Inter-language dependencies: If your project has tight coupling between languages, a mono repo facilitates easy tracking of dependency changes.
    - **Cons:**
      - Complexity: Larger codebases can become unwieldy, especially for teams with various skillsets.
      - Build challenges: Different languages might require distinct build processes, potentially increasing complexity.
      - Testing considerations: Testing strategies might need adjustments to ensure cross-language functionality remains stable.

  - **Poly Repo (Pros & Cons):**
    - **Pros:**
      - Improved organization: Separate repositories for each language enhance clarity and maintainability.
      - Team specialization: Developers can focus on their language strengths.
      - Scalability: Easier to onboard contributors familiar with specific languages.
    - **Cons:**
      - Version control overhead: Managing dependencies across multiple repositories adds complexity.
      - Inter-language communication: Strategies for inter-language communication (e.g., APIs, events) become necessary.

**3. Folder Structure for Mono Repo:**

Here's a suggestive folder structure for a mono repo:

```
project_root/
├── languages/
│   ├── java/
│   │   └── src/  (Java source code)
│   ├── javascript/
│   │   ├── frontend/ (JavaScript frontend code)
│   │   └── backend/  (JavaScript backend code, e.g., Node.js)
│   └── python/
│       └── src/  (Python source code)
├── Dockerfile  (Optional, for containerized deployments)
├── README.md  (Project documentation)
└── ...  (Other project-specific files)
```

**Tooling for Managing Mono Repo:**

- **Git Large File Storage (LFS):** If your project contains large binary assets, consider using Git LFS to improve performance and storage efficiency.
- **Dependency Management:** Explore tools like `Nx` ([https://nx.dev/](https://nx.dev/)) or `Bazel` ([https://bazel.build/](https://bazel.build/)) to streamline dependency management and build processes across languages within a mono repo.
- **Build Orchestration:** Tools like `Make` or `Apache Maven` (for Java) can assist in automating and streamlining the build process for various languages.
- **Testing Frameworks:** For comprehensive testing coverage, leverage language-specific frameworks like JUnit (Java), Jest (JavaScript), and Pytest (Python).

**Interesting Questions and Ideas:**

- **What are the trade-offs between using a mono repo and a poly repo for your specific project?** Carefully consider the factors mentioned above to make an informed decision.
- **How will you handle inter-language dependencies within your chosen structure?** This is crucial for ensuring seamless code interaction.
- **How will you structure your build system to accommodate different languages?** Dependency management and build automation tools can be invaluable allies.
- **What testing strategies will you employ to guarantee the quality of code across languages?** Utilize appropriate frameworks to write unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests.
- **Can you leverage infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools like Terraform** to manage cloud deployments for your web applications, regardless of their programming languages?

By carefully considering these aspects and experimenting with different approaches, you can establish an effective workflow for your multi-language project.
