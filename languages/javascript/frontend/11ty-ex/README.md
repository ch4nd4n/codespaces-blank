# 11ty-ex

A simple example of using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) to build a static site.

## How to use

1. Open a terminal in the root of this repository
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

> If you are using codespaces, the terminal should show a message about the port being in use. Click on "open in browser". 
> The root page would not show up anything, so you can open the `README` file in the browser to see the site.
